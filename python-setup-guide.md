## So you've installed Python. Now what?

Let's try printing 'Hello World'.

### Creating your program
1. Create a folder for your programs.
2. Open a text editor. (I am going to use Notepad here to keep things simple but I recommend you start using Sublime Text as shown in the videos)
3. Write the following in the file and save it;
```
print('Hello World')
```
I am naming the file 'first_program.py'.

*Note: Don't forget the py at then end, it is important!*

### Running your program

1. Open your command line. (On Windows you can search for cmd)

2. Navigate to your folder in the command line. Below are images of navigating both a file manager and the cmd for comparison.

*Shortcut: Instead of all those 'cd's, you can directly go to the path in one go*

Also, when using 'cd' make sure you are in the same drive. For example, I am already in D drive. (To go from, say, C to D enter 'D:' at the prompt)

3. To run your program, enter 'python first_program.py' into the command line.

*Note: In case you get an error like the following*

*Try following this guide: https://github.com/BurntSushi/nfldb/wiki/Python-&-pip-Windows-installation*

### Bonus: Interpreter 

You can also execute code on the Python interpreter where you write one line of code at a time.

You can either call python from the command line;

Or search for Python (clicking on it will take you to the >>> prompt)

Note: Technically, when you call 'python first_program.py' you are also calling the python interpreter which executes the code in your file line by line. The difference is that you do not have to write the code one line at a time.

*Congratulations! You've executed your first Python program :)*
