## So you've installed Python. Now what?

Let's try printing 'Hello World'.

### Creating your program
1. Create a folder for your programs.
2. Open a text editor. (I am going to use Notepad here to keep things simple but I recommend you start using Sublime Text as shown in the videos)
3. Write the following in the file and save it;
```
print('Hello World')
```
I am naming the file 'first_program.py'.

*Note: Don't forget the py at then end, it is important!*

### Running your program


1. Open your command line. (On Windows you can search for cmd)

1. Navigate to your folder
