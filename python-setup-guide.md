## So you've installed Python. Now what?

Let's try printing 'Hello World'.

### Creating your program
1. Create a folder for your programs.
2. Open a text editor. (I am going to use Notepad here to keep things simple but I recommend you start using Sublime Text as shown in the videos)
3. Write the following in the file and save it;
```
print('Hello World')
```
I am naming the file 'first_program.py'.

*Note: Don't forget the py at then end, it is important!*

### Running your program

1. Open your command line. (On Windows you can search for cmd)

2. Navigate to your folder in the command line. Below are images of navigating both a file manager and the cmd for comparison.

3. To run your program, enter 'python first_program.py' into the command line.

*Note: In case you get an error like the following*
